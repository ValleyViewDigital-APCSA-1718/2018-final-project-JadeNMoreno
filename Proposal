M.A.S.H

Project Summary: 
This will be an interactive game that determines the playerâ€™s future. 
It will use an ArrayList for the player to input values into each category by the add method. 
It will then remove a value in a pattern after each category has been filled out. 
It will then return the last value left with a loop or if statement as well. 
This game provides the player with a fun way to predict their future. 
It contains multiple different versions of MASH. 
The player will able to predict their basic future, their wedding, or their honeymoon. 
These classes are all related due to inheritance, so they have the ability to use the super class as it runs. 
There as well is an abstract class with a method that will tell the player how a language is being used at event or in life. 
This will change based on what version of MASH is being played.
